# Robust-Feature-Engineering-for-Fall-Detection-and-Activity-Recognition

Description of each file: 

#### OLD_EDA: Contains initial Exploratory Data Analysis where thousand of raw data was converted into a single master data. Sequential Feature selection, checking for missing data, skewness, and various base models


#### Models: Include Multi-Logistic Classification, SVM, kNN, Random Forest, and Neural Network Models on data after feature engineering. 

#### DSCI303 VISUALIZATIONS: Includes correlation matrixes, tSNE, and scatterplots on features. 

#### DSCI 303 Final Project New Features: Includes feature engineering that crates the master dataset used.
